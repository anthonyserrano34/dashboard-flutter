          <strong>CloudBuilder</strong> , Xtralife.cloud's framework, is a one
          stop shop tool to let you manage dematerialized playersâ€™ data and
          information, as well as interactions with other players, in a
          completely cross-platform way. As long as the player engages in a game
          or application which is connected, notwithstanding which platform is
          used, he will retrieve all his history and accumulated progress. It is
          designed in a modular way, organized in several layers in order to
          benefit from automated load-balancing, and absorb any peak of usage
          very quickly.
