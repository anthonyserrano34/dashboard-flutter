		<p><strong>CloudBuilder</strong>, Xtralife.cloud's framework, is a one stop shop tool to let you manage dematerialized playersâ€™ data and information, as well as interactions with other players, in a completely cross-platform way. As long as the player engages in a game or application which is connected, notwithstanding which platform is used, he will retrieve all his history and accumulated progress.
		It is designed in a modular way, organized in several layers in order to benefit from automated load-balancing, and absorb any peak of usage very quickly.</p>
