## MSG is an asynchronous distributed message bus

MSG can be seen as a cloud peer-to-peer chat system designed to handle a large number of clients talking asynchronously to each other.

It relies on a Redis backend to provide both persistence and to distribute messages among many MSG processes.

## How to use MSG

First add it to your package.json

	"dependencies": {
		"xtralife-msg": "*"
	}
